## Professional Experience

**Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN**<br>
*Research Intern* | Jun 2025 – Dec 2025
 -	Developed a spatially distributed, data-driven hydrologic modeling framework across 921 North American catchments.
 -	Achieved improved streamflow predictions compared to lumped models, with NSE and KGE increased in 75.4% and 72.9% of catchments, respectively.

**Fujitsu Research of America, Santa Clara, CA**<br>
*AI Research Intern* | Oct 2024 – Jun 2025  
-	Develop an AI-foundation model for global flooding prediction, benchmarked against Google’s LSTM model across over 6,000 catchments while reducing 87% computing length.
-	Tackled landslide data scarcity by leveraging a multi-task learning framework jointly trained with streamflow signals, achieving a 12% performance improvement compared to NASA’s operational XGBoost model.
