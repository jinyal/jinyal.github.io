Hi! I‚Äôm **Jinyang (ÊùéÈáëÊ¥ã)**, a 4th-year Ph.D. candidate at University of California, Irvine, advised by Prof. Kuo-lin Hsu and Prof. Soroosh Sorooshian. I‚Äôm expected to graduate in Fall 2025. Before my graduate studies at UCI, I earned my B.S. in Environmental Science from Sichuan University, China.

My research focuses on applying advanced AI techniques and remote sensing to improve hydrologic modeling and support decision-making. I work on a range of topics including rainfall-runoff/flooding modeling, reservoir simulation and operation, and invasive species habitat prediction. I am particularly interested in large-scale hydrologic modeling at continental to global scales.
