Hi! I’m **Jinyang**, a 5th-year Ph.D. candidate in Computational Hydrology at the University of California, Irvine, advised by [Prof. Soroosh Sorooshian](https://engineering.uci.edu/users/soroosh-sorooshian) and [Prof. Kuo-lin Hsu](https://chrs.web.uci.edu/chrs_directory.php). I have also interned at [Fujitsu Research](https://global.fujitsu/en-us/local/technology/research) and [Oak Ridge National Laboratory](https://www.ornl.gov/directorate/ccsd), working on contiential to global AI-based hydrologic and landslide modeling.

<!--in Environmental Science -->

My research focuses on **leveraging advanced AI and remote sensing techniques to improve hydrologic modeling and inform decision-making**. I work on a range of topics, including global rainfall–runoff and landslide modeling, cascade reservoir simulation and operation, and invasive species habitat prediction. I am particularly interested in large-scale hydrologic modeling.

I will graduate in March 2026 and join UC Berkeley as a postdoctoral researcher in April 2026. <!--at the intersection of AI, hydrology, and remote sensing-->

<!--News: I was awarded the [AGU23 Outstanding Student Presentation Award (OSPA)](https://www.agu.org/honors/ospa/past-recipients)-->
