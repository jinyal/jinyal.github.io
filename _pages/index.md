Hi! I’m **Jinyang (李金洋)**, a 5th-year Ph.D. candidate in Hydrology and Water Resources Engineering at **University of California, Irvine**, advised by [Prof. Soroosh Sorooshian](https://engineering.uci.edu/users/soroosh-sorooshian) and [Prof. Kuo-lin Hsu](https://chrs.web.uci.edu/chrs_directory.php). I was also intern at [Fujitsu Research](https://global.fujitsu/en-us/local/technology/research) and [Oak Ridge National Laboratory](https://www.ornl.gov/directorate/ccsd).

<!--in Environmental Science -->

My research focuses on leveraging advanced AI and remote sensing techniques to improve hydrologic modeling and support decision-making. I work on a range of topics including global rainfall-runoff/flooding modeling, cascade reservoir simulation and operation, and invasive species habitats prediction. I am particularly interested in large-scale hydrologic modeling at continental to global scales.

**I'll be graduating in Jan-2026, and I'm actively seeking postdoc and research scientist positions starting in Mar-2026 or later, at the intersection of AI, hydrology, and remote sensing**. 

<!--News: I was awarded the [AGU23 Outstanding Student Presentation Award (OSPA)](https://www.agu.org/honors/ospa/past-recipients)-->
